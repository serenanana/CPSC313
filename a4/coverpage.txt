By typing my/our name(s) and student number(s)s in the list below,
I/we certify that the work in the attached assignment was performed
ONLY BY ME/US except the parts that have been properly acknowledged in
the assignment and below. In addition, we indicate that we are fully

When working in pairs, one of you will fill in this form with their
personal information and then commit and push it to stash. The
remaining person is to then pull the changes to their copy of the repo,
add their personal information to the form and then commit and
push the changes back to stash. Stash records who is responsible for
the various commits, it is therefore very important that each of you
submit this form from your own account. 

Adding the cover page is the last thing you are to do as part of the
assignment submission process. If you make changes after submitting
this file then you should make a minor change to the file, such as
adding a comment in the Acknowledgement section and then resubmit the
file. If working in pairs both of you must do this.
